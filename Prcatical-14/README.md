MongoDB DDL, DCL, and DML Execution using Node.js

##  Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform **DDL**, **DCL**, and **DML** operations in **MongoDB** using **Node.js** and **Mongoose**.  
It covers how databases and collections are created (DDL), how data is manipulated (DML), and a conceptual overview of access control (DCL).  
All operations are executed through a Node.js server running on **localhost:3000**.
